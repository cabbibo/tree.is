      <p> Infinity Box was one of the first projects that we worked on together. We have both been very excited about the concept of completely procedural worlds, and wanted to see if it was possible to create something that was both completely procedurally generated, as well as beautiful. Its easy enough for us to create possibility spaces that are infinite, but to create infinite spaces that are beautiful is a much more difficult task.</p>
      <p> In infinity box, all of the audio is created using an audio programming language called 'Pure Data', and all of the visuals are created using raytraced Signed Distance Fields. If you want to read more about Signed Distance fields, check out the blog, or <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xl2XWt">this tutorial on Shadertoy</a>.</p>

      <p> Continuing with our obsession of Signed Distance Fields, we wanted to see if we could create a 'gallery' of these magical mathematical beauties. Each one of the sculptures and paintings was made from the same basic primitives, which can be found hanging on the ends of the rooms.</p>
      <p> We have found that many times when people talk about 'VR' they always talk about something being 'The first "x" in VR'. Although the momentous occasion of creating somthing that humanity has never seen before is completely unbelievable, we have always tried to take this one step further which is that we want to create the first BEAUTIFUL "x" in VR. It is not just important for something to be new, it must also move the human conciousness forward in some positive direction. Although we may or may not have been able to reach that point with this project, it is always something we strive for!</p>
