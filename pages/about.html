    <p> Luke is one lucky boy. While growing up in tuscon, he learned about the magic of computers at a very early age. Through the sharing power of the internet, he honed his bit wizardy as well as his deep love for all concious beings on this planet. He now resides in Oakland, in a house with two lovely cats, and 1 billion VR rigs his friends couldn't care for properly. </p>
